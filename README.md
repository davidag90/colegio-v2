## About

Colegio Theme is a custom developmed theme created to support the official website of the **Colegio Odontológico de la Provincia de Córdoba** and works as a child theme of Understrap.

## Basic Features

- Combines Underscore’s PHP/JS files and Bootstrap’s HTML/CSS/JS through the use of Understrap.
- Uses sass and postCSS to handle compiling all of the styles into one style sheet. The theme also includes rollup.js to handle javascript compilation and minification.
- Uses a single minified CSS file for all the basic stuff
- Jetpack ready
- WooCommerce support
- Contact Form 7 support
- Translation ready

## Bootstrap 5 (and Bootstrap 4) Support

This child theme uses Bootstrap 5 and requires [Understrap Parent Theme 1.1](https://wordpress.org/themes/understrap) or greater for best functionality. It does not create JS or CSS files that work with Bootstrap 4 markup.
